        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This chewy blondie recipe is made in just one bowl(no mixer required) and includes 7 ingredients with an optional 8th of chocolate chips or whatever you want.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg + 1 large egg yolk, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Line an 8x8" baking pan with parchement paper and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl whisk together the melted butter and brown sugar. Add the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract and mix well. Don't overmix.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl stir together the baking powder, salt, and flour. Add the wet ingredients into the dry and fold together until just mixed and no clumps of flour remain. Fold in the chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into your prepared pan, spreading into an even layer.</li>
            <li>Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until the blondies are golden brown, set on the edges and have puffed up. The middle will still be undercooked, but will continue to cook as they cool.</li>
            <li>Once the blondies are cool, cut into 9 squares for big blondies, or 16 for smaller portions and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
