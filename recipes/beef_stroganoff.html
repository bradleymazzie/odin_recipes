        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Ground beef stroganoff with or without a side. If you so choose to forgo the egg noodles, it can be served over rice or mashed potatoes.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can fat-free condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Saut√© ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly; 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Drain and discard any fat from the cooked beef. Stir condensed soup and garlic powder into the beef. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Remove beef from the heat. Add egg noodles and stir to combine. Stir in sour cream and season with salt and pepper.</li>
        </ol>
